### Generate Mock Events

This extension makes it easy to generate and send mock events to your Event Grid subscriptions. It leverages [json-schema-faker](https://github.com/json-schema-faker/json-schema-faker/blob/master/README.md) to automatically generate mock data from a json schema. If you have an existing Event Subscription, you can right click on that resource and select 'Create Mock Event Generator'. You may also select 'Create Mock Event Generator' from the title bar if you want to send events of any type to an arbitrary endpoint.

A json file with the following properties will be created:

* destination: The destination to use when sending events. The endpointUrl can be specified directly, or you can specify the id of an Event Subscription and the endpointUrl will be automatically determined for that resource.
* numberOfEvents: The number of events to generate and send.
* jsonSchemaFakerOptions: The [options](https://github.com/json-schema-faker/json-schema-faker/blob/master/README.md#custom-options) to pass in to json-schema-faker.
* schema: The JSON schema for your specific event, with additional metadata on how to generate mock data. You may use the [standard keywords](https://github.com/json-schema-faker/json-schema-faker/blob/master/README.md#supported-keywords) supported by json-schema-faker or [Chance.js](https://github.com/json-schema-faker/json-schema-faker/blob/master/README.md#advanced-usage-of-fakerjs-and-chancejs) for more advanced scenarios.

Once you have an event generator, you can customize the schema, select "Preview Events" to see what gets generated, and select "Send Events" to send generated events to your Event Subscription's endpoint.

## Managing Azure Subscriptions

The [Azure Account extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azure-account) is used to manage authentication. It is installed automatically with this extension. If you want to sign in to specific tenant set the azure.tenant setting in the [Azure Account extension](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azure-account).

If you are not signed in to Azure, you will see a "Sign in to Azure..." link. Alternatively, you can select "View->Command Palette" in the VS Code menu, and search for "Azure: Sign In".

If you don't have an Azure Account, you can sign up for one today for free and receive $200 in credits by selecting "Create a Free Azure Account..." or selecting "View->Command Palette" and searching for "Azure: Create an Account".

You may sign out of Azure by selecting "View->Command Palette" and searching for "Azure: Sign Out".

To select which subscriptions show up in the extension's explorer, click on the "Select Subscriptions..." button on any subscription node (indicated by a "filter" icon when you hover over it), or select "View->Command Palette" and search for "Azure: Select Subscriptions". Note that this selection affects all VS Code extensions that support the [Azure Account and Sign-In](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-azure-account) extension.
